# Final Project – URP-5393: Urban Planning Methods II

**Objective**: Assess students’ knowledge and application of Urban Planning Methods

**Instructions**:
- Accept the midterm repository invite and create your private repository (sent to your UTSA email)
- Choose between submitting a power-point based project (see: ), or a HTML RMarkdown-based project (see: )
  - For those using a power point based project, create an R-Script with all your R code used in your final project (this needs to be reproducible by me) 
- Open the corresponding template and fill it with your content
- When done click on ‘knit’ and the commit and push. You can commit and push as many times as you want/need, however, _make sure you last push has the final powwer-point or HTML products. I will only review the last push looking for the power-point and HTML files._
- `All work is individual`. All final answers are due on **05/10/2023 at 17:00**. Commits pushed after the due date will not be reviewed.
